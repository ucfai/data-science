    Welcome to the data science group! In this meeting, we will dive right in and immediately get
    all members into a group based on project interests. In addition, group leaders will be assigned, 
    and coordinators will facilitate narrowing down of projects. Get comfortable, as these will be your
    teammates as you spend the semester tearing apart dataset after dataset!

    The titanic dataset is often considered the "hello world" of data science. In this workshop, we will
    use this relatively simple dataset to help get you comfortable with the kind of workflow that will be 
    used in the data science group. By the end of this workshop, all groups will be comfortable with the 
    end-to-end process of data analysis, model selection, model fitting, and finally submission to kaggle.
    As always, you will have the opporunity to compete with the other groups!
